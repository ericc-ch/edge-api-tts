# Edge TTS API

Small Flask wrapper to use edge-tts. Easier to use for my Sludge AI project rather than being dependent on edge-tts being intalled via pipx.

## Run Locally

I need this because I'm not good with Python.

Go to the project directory

```bash
cd edge-tts-api
```

Setup a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv

```

Activate the virtual environment

```bash
. .venv/bin/activate

```

Install the requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
